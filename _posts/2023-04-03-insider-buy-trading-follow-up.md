title: Follow up - Trading on Insider Buys
excerpt: A follow up on trading on insider buys.
---

<a target="_blank" href="https://blog.vikhed.in/insider-buy-trading/">In our previous blog post</a>, we explored a trading strategy based on insider buying. We saw that the strategy performed well over a backtesting period of 69 months from January 2016 to September 2021. However, it's always important to evaluate a trading strategy on new data to see if it continues to perform well. You can check the updated results <a target="_blank" href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1xtWw99OCv7bAe1NdQNfGYB0Nir4rK8oo/edit#gid=1574867501">in this excel</a>

To recap, we look at the top buys of a month, say January, and buy the stock on the first day of February and sell it either when it hits stop loss, or the last day of February. There is a lot of optimisations one can do with this - let winners run, buy the top 3 companies etc. We have run a backtest for the simple strategy on new data from November 2021 to March 2023, which is a period of 17 months. Here are the results:

**From**						|	01-11-2021
**To**							|	31-03-2023
**Corpus**						|	200000
**Stop Loss**					|	-0.05
**Net Return**					|	53%
**Monthly Average**				|	6229.117647
**CMGR**						|	2.95%
**Max Profit**					|	39822
**Max Month**					|	01-12-2021
**Max Company**					|	INDHOTEL
**Short Term Capital Gains**	|	15%
**Tax**							|	45884.25
**Post Tax Net**				|	260010.75
**Post Tax Return**				|	30.01%
**No, of positive months**		|	9
**No, of negative months**		|	8


Overall, the results suggest that the insider buying strategy can still be a profitable trading strategy in the short term. However, as always, it's important to do your own research and evaluate the strategy on your own data before making any investment decisions.

In terms of implementation, you can start off with an amount you can afford to lose and subscribe to a <a target="_blank" href="https://vikhed.in/insider-summary">monthly insider summary newsletter</a> to get updates on companies with maximum insider buying and selling. You can buy the company with maximum buying and hold until the end of the month, while monitoring the stock price for stoploss.
