excerpt: A follow up on trading on insider buys.

<a target="_blank" href="https://blog.vikhed.in/insider-buy-trading/">In our previous blog post</a>, we explored a trading strategy based on insider buying. We saw that the strategy performed well over a backtesting period of 69 months from January 2016 to September 2021. However, it's always important to evaluate a trading strategy on new data to see if it continues to perform well. You can check the updated results <a target="_blank" href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1xtWw99OCv7bAe1NdQNfGYB0Nir4rK8oo/edit#gid=1574867501">in this excel</a>

So, we decided to run the same strategy on new data from November 2021 to March 2023, which is a period of 17 months. Here are the results:

|   **Duration**					|	Nov 2021 to March 2023		|	Feb 2016 to March 2023
|   **Corpus**						|	200000						|	200000
|   **Stop Loss**					|	-5%							|	-5%
|   **Net Return With SL**			|	74%							|	252%
|   **Net Return Without SL**		|	43%							|	49%
|   **Monthly Average With SL**		|	8745.211765					|	5859.544463
|   **Monthly Average Without SL**	|	5062.976471					|	1137.978153
|   **CAGR/CMGR**					|	3.64% (CMGR)				|	19.8% (CAGR)
|   **Max Profit**					|	39822						|	55534.31983
|   **Max Monthly**					|	01-12-2021					|	01-11-2020
|   **Max Company**					|	INDHOTEL					|	ELGIEQUIP
|   **STCG Tax**					|	15%							|	15%
|   **Tax**							|	52300.29 					|	105588.1236
|   **Post Tax Net**				|	296368.135 					|	598332.7003
|   **Post Tax Return**				|	48.18%						|	199.17%
|   **No. of positive months**		|	11 							|	46
|   **No. of negative months**		|	6 							|	40


Overall, the results suggest that the insider buying strategy can still be a profitable trading strategy in the short term. However, as always, it's important to do your own research and evaluate the strategy on your own data before making any investment decisions.

In terms of implementation, you can start off with an amount you can afford to lose and subscribe to a <a target="_blank" href="https://vikhed.in/insider-summary">monthly insider summary newsletter</a> to get updates on companies with maximum insider buying and selling. You can buy the company with maximum buying and hold until the end of the month. However, it's important to monitor the stock price for stop loss to reduce the risk of losses during negative months.
