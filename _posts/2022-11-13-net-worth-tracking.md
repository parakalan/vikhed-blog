### Why Monitoring Your Net Worth is Important

I started earning around three years ago, out of college. It took sometime for me to understand that tracking my investments and gauging my financial health is important. I fear that most people who pass out of college in India, are not financially aware. Too many people know very less about investing. It is my strong opinion that everyone should be financially aware, have enough savings and invest prudently. I’ll list out some questions and answer them.

### Why should I worry about money? I have a good job out of college which pays well.

First of, kudos for the nice job with good pay! 

Now, there are a few reasons why you should still worry about money, even if you have a good job. The first reason is that your job could always change. You could get laid off, especially in a market like this.[1] If you don't have savings, it could be difficult to tide yourself over during a period of unemployment. The second reason is that your financial situation could always change. You could have unexpected expenses, like medical bills, that could eat into your savings. Or, you might want to make a major purchase, like a home or a car, and you'll need to have the money saved up in order to do so. So, even if you're doing well financially now, it's still important to be mindful of your money and to make sure that you're saving for the future.

### I have some people to look after my money, I don’t think I need to sweat it.

It's still important to be involved in your finances, even if you have someone else managing them for you. You need to be aware of what's going on with your money so that you can make sure that everything is on track. Additionally, if something does happen, like you lose your job or have an unexpected expense, you'll need to be able to make decisions about how to best use your money. There is one more reason - most of us make financial decisions based on what our parents did, or just leave it to them entirely. With all due respect to the previous generation, they did what was right to their generation. The stock market, for example was rigged, and investing in stocks was very very risky.

### Seems like you are just scaring me to sell something. 

It is true that pessimism sells. [https://www.wealthmanagement.com/prospecting/power-pessimism-sales]. But that is surely not what I am doing. I know too many people who seem to not know enough about finance. And that truly scares me. 

### How do I monitor my net worth?

I made a Google Sheet template to monitor my net worth. It is a pretty simple way to keep track of my investments.
